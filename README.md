# CS 564 – Database Management Systems (Spring 2023)

This repository contains the final project for **CS 564: Database Management Systems** at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. The course project involved designing and building an interactive database application from start to finish, including schema design, implementation, indexing, and a working application interface.

---

## 📖 Project Overview

The objective of this project was to:

- Select a real-world application domain requiring a relational database
- Model the domain using ER diagrams and normalization
- Design and implement a relational database schema
- Populate the database with realistic data
- Implement a B+ tree indexing mechanism (conceptually or through code)
- Build an interactive application interface to interact with the database
- Deliver a final report and live demonstration

---

## 📱 Final Application: Player Management System

This project is a **web-based database application** built with:

- **Backend Framework:** Django (Python)
- **Frontend:** HTML/CSS (basic)
- **Database:** MySQL

The application was designed to manage data for a sports player management system, including entities such as players, teams, games, rankings, and game details.

### ✅ Completed Features

- **Add, Delete, Search, and Update functionality for the `player` table**
- Integration of MySQL with Django models and views
- Basic web interface to perform CRUD operations on player records

### ❌ Incomplete / Planned Features

Due to lack of contribution from other team members and time limitations:

- No React.js frontend integration (planned but not implemented)
- No working CRUD operations for `team`, `ranking`, `game`, and `game_detail` tables
- No implementation of complex query translations for advanced reports
- Conceptual B+ tree design completed, but not integrated into the live database system

| Deliverable               | Status                         |
|:--------------------------|:--------------------------------|
| Project proposal & ER diagram | ✅ Completed |
| Revised ER diagram & normalization | ✅ Completed |
| B+ Tree conceptual design | ✅ Completed (not implemented in DBMS) |
| Query functionalities | ⚠️ Partial (player table only) |
| Final report | ✅ Submitted |
| 15-minute presentation | ✅ Delivered |

## 📌 Lessons Learned

- End-to-end database application development with Django and MySQL
- Schema design, ER modeling, and normalization for a real-world domain
- Experience managing incomplete group projects and self-directing work
- Hands-on practice with CRUD operations and database integration in a web app

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python 3
- **Framework:** Django
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Frontend:** HTML/CSS (basic)
- **OS/Environment:** Local development (macOS/Linux/Windows)

---

## ⚠️ Notes

This was a group project with incomplete group collaboration. As a result, some planned features remain unimplemented, and the web application is functional only for basic operations on the `player` table.
