# CS564-Final-Project
Final Database project
This project is a web application made using Django python, html, and mysql.
Only the add, delete, search, and update functions for the player table works.
This was a group project, but other group members did not contribute, so it lacks
react.js functionalities, some query translations of more complex queries, and 
does not work for team, ranking, game, game_detail tables.
